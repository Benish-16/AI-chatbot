# AI-chatbot
<h1>Description:</h1>
<p>Developed a sophisticated university chatbot leveraging natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning techniques to enhance student interactions. The chatbot, implemented using Python and TensorFlow, is designed to handle various student inquiries, including course information, schedule inquiries, campus facilities, deadlines, and academic support. Utilizing NLTK for tokenization and lemmatization, and TensorFlow for model training, the chatbot accurately predicts user intents and provides relevant responses based on a well-defined set of intents and patterns. The chatbot also includes a dynamic HTML interface for seamless integration with Jupyter notebooks, featuring a styled chat layout with color-coded user and bot responses for enhanced user experience. The model is trained on diverse data to ensure high accuracy and is saved in the HDF5 format for efficient deployment. This project demonstrates a strong understanding of machine learning, NLP, and web-based user interface design.</p>
